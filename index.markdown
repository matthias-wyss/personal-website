# About me {#About}

I am a French and Swiss first-year Master's student in Data Science at EPFL, pursuing a minor in Financial Engineering. Curious and eager to learn, I enjoy discovering new things and adapt quickly to different environments. I completed a two-month internship at Adequasys as an Artificial Intelligence Intern and currently work part-time in the Poseidon IT department at EPFL. My main interests lie in data science, financial engineering, programming, and mathematics.
