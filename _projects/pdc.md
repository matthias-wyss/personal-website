**CipherLink** simulates a full **digital communication chain** capable of transmitting a 40-character message over a noisy channel with perfect decoding and **minimal energy use**.

The system was developed for the **Principles of Digital Communications** course and was recognized as the **winner among all class projects**.

Our pipeline includes:
- **Source and channel encoding**
- **Noisy transmission**
- **Error-free decoding** using advanced coding strategies

We optimized the system to achieve perfect reconstruction at the receiver while minimizing **energy costs**.
