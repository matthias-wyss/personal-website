**Crypto** is a **Java-based tool** developed as part of an introductory programming project at **EPFL**, designed to **encrypt** and **decrypt text** using a variety of **classical** and **modern algorithms**. The tool provides both **command-line** execution and configuration through simple text files, offering an insightful learning experience into cryptographic techniques and basic programming concepts.

### Key Features:
- **Encryption schemes supported**:
  - **Caesar cipher**
  - **Vigen√®re cipher**
  - **XOR encryption**
  - **One-Time Pad (OTP)**
  - **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**
  
- **File I/O** support for input/output operations and text file manipulation.
- **Brute-force search** and **statistical decoding** for attacking weak encryption schemes.
- **Modular arithmetic** for handling encryption and decryption of data.

### Skills and Techniques:
This project served as an **introduction to cryptographic fundamentals**, enhancing skills in:
- **Algorithm implementation**
- **File I/O**
- **Basic security principles** using Java
