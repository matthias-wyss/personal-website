**Hedemon** is a blockchain-powered platform that transforms physical **Pok√©mon cards into verifiable NFTs** using **Hedera Hashgraph**.

The platform ensures **authenticity**, **ownership**, and **privacy** by integrating:
- **Cryptographic hashing**
- **Smart contracts**
- **Machine learning-based fraud detection**

Developed during the **Privacy and Verifiability Hackathon** hosted by the EPFL Blockchain Student Association, the solution uses a **machine learning model** to detect **counterfeit cards** prior to minting.

Authentic cards are then converted into NFTs using **Hedera Token Service** and **Hedera Consensus Service**, enabling secure, low-cost transactions with **privacy-preserving techniques**.

Though initially designed for Pok√©mon cards, the approach is **scalable** to other assets like **ID documents** or **diplomas**.
