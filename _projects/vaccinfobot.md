**VaccInfoBot** is a fully automated **Twitter bot** written in **Java** that publishes daily statistics on the progression of **COVID-19 vaccinations** around the world. It leverages real-time vaccination data to provide timely and region-specific updates across multiple dedicated Twitter accounts, including by continent, world region, and vaccine dose type.

Key features of the project:
- **Global coverage** with region-specific accounts like **@VaccInfoBot_Eur**, **@VaccInfoBot_Am**, etc., ensuring tweets are timed throughout the day to match various time zones.
- Emphasis on **clean data visualization** to present vaccination statistics in a user-friendly format.
- Fully **automated operations** with scheduled tweets based on real-time vaccination data.
- **Modular code** to easily scale and add more regions and datasets.

The project highlights my experience with **web automation**, **REST API integration**, **multithreading**, and creating **social media bots** that interact with real-world data to keep users informed.
