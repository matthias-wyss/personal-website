In this project, we implemented a fully functional version of **Conway‚Äôs Game of Life** in **MIPS-like assembly** on a multicycle **Nios II processor**, running on the **Gecko4Education board**. The project involved writing the entire game logic, including cell state transitions, user controls (pause, speed adjustment, seed selection), and dynamic state updates, in low-level assembly‚Äîwithout relying on any OS or runtime support.

Key tasks included:
- Translating high-level algorithmic logic into efficient assembly code compatible with the Nios II processor.
- Managing memory-mapped I/O to interact with the **LED matrix**, **7-segment display**, and **push buttons** for user interaction.
- Ensuring proper **stack usage** and **subroutine structure** to maintain compatibility with the simulator's grading and execution system.

The project focused heavily on **low-level debugging**, **hardware simulation**, and **state machine design**, giving us hands-on experience with embedded systems and processor-level execution flow.
