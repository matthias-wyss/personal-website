# üé≤ Wordle ‚Äì A Python Clone of the Popular Word Game

In this project, I recreated **Wordle**, the viral word puzzle game originally created by Josh Wardle, using **Python** and **Pygame**. The game supports word lengths of **5**, **6**, or **7** letters, and follows the original **Wordle mechanics**, where players have a limited number of attempts to guess the hidden word of the day.

Key features of the project include:
- **Dynamic input handling** and **color-coded feedback** for guesses.
- **Daily word selection** fetched from an online API using the **requests library**.
- The game was designed to be easily installed and run on any platform with **Python 3**, and includes a simple **CLI-based setup** with clear instructions for users.

This project allowed me to apply and improve skills in **game development**, **GUI design**, and **API integration**, as well as refining my ability to work with **Python packaging** to make the game easy to distribute.
