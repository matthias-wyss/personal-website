rank: 8
year: 2023
description: >
  In this project, we explored quantum approaches to solving the NP-complete 3-SAT problem using Grover's algorithm and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). We implemented an oracle that encodes 3-SAT clauses as quantum gates and applied Grover's algorithm and QPE to search for satisfying assignments and estimate the number of solutions.

In this project, we explored **quantum approaches** to solving the **NP-complete 3-SAT problem** using **Grover's algorithm** and **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**. The 3-SAT problem involves determining if there exists a satisfying assignment for a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form with three literals per clause.

We implemented an **oracle** that encodes 3-SAT clauses as quantum gates, allowing us to apply Grover's algorithm to search for satisfying assignments. Additionally, **QPE** was used to estimate the number of solutions to the problem. Simulations were performed using **Qiskit** on **IBM quantum backends**, and the results were compared with classical methods to evaluate the potential quantum speedup.
