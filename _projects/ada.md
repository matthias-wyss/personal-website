rank: 13
year: 2024
description: >
  This project investigates the emotional dimensions of storytelling using a large corpus of over 11,000 movie summaries enriched with 450,000 IMDb reviews. We used HuggingFace’s Emotion DistilRoBERTa model to extract primary emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust, neutrality), then applied statistical correlations, PCA, and K-Means clustering to map emotional trends across genres and narratives.

This project investigates the emotional dimensions of storytelling using a large corpus of over 11,000 movie summaries enriched with 450,000 IMDb reviews.

We used **HuggingFace’s Emotion DistilRoBERTa** model to extract primary emotions — *joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust, neutrality* — then applied statistical correlations, **PCA**, and **K-Means clustering** to map emotional trends across genres and narratives.

Inspired by *Inside Out*, our project features a visual storytelling approach, integrating emotion-based visualizations like **word clouds** and **heatmaps** to offer an engaging exploration of genre-emotion relationships.
